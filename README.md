# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
  In this project a data analysis was performed for Louise's crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play Fever. We will hwlp her by uncovering hidden trends within the data to help her have a successful campaign. First, understanding how to manuever and use excel and it's functions were an important first step for this analysis. The kickstarter excel file was then downloaded and reviewed to see how many columns and rows were present, what type of data was present, and if the data needs to be converted. 

## Analysis and Challenges
  There were some difficulties that I encountered while doing the challenge. One of them was writing the Countifs formula for the "Outcome Based On Goals" sheet for the successful, failed, and canceled columns. I kept getting an error becaause I had trouble figuring out how to write the required goal into the formula. With some help from my classmates on Slack I eventually got the right formula.

## Results
  For the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Sheet" in Excel I can conclude that in the Month's of May June were the most successful. Meaning this is around the perfect time for Louise to do theater. Another point I can conclude from the pivot chart is the month of January had the highest number of canceled for the theater. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106411743/172931809-badd2982-71e3-45fc-8538-b6240261e157.png)

   A conclusion I made on the "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheets is the successful goal points and and failed goal points fluctuate throughout the chart. For the goal of 15,000 to 19,999 the successful goals reached it's highest percentage of 100. And for the range of 45000 to 49999 the failed goals reached it's highest point of 100 percent.![Outcomes Based on Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106411743/172931139-5beae510-a99e-4c2a-b866-7d89c7998891.png)
 We can also do tables and charts on the backers_count and spotlight to get a better understanding of the data.
